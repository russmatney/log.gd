*** preview (short-version) of docs example page
*** non-Log.gd-based godot printing quick hits
- print, prints, printt, print_rich
- print_verbose

"Don't want to install a whole addon? Here's a godot print helper overview"
*** A/B differences between Log.pr() and print()
for an object, a node, a list, a dictionary
*** features, with code and screenshots
**** pretty-printing primitives
**** pretty-printing arrays and dicts
**** opting-in to prettier/limited classes/objects
#+begin_src gdscript
func to_printable():
    {your=str(value)}
#+end_src
**** call-site prefixes
*** _not_ a production log-to-file helper
but maybe that's a future direction?
*** prior art
** [ ] Docs: 'Example' page
walk through the ExampleScene.gd
with individual line-by-line output screenshots
** [ ] Example scene should have buttons for printing more things
the example outputs could also colorize and print the source code - that output might
be a fun sharable version of the tutorial (i.e. the tutorial is all printed via Log.gd)
** [ ] docs full api page
** [ ] call-site prefix test coverage
** [ ] comb docs for todos
* v1.0.0
** [ ] list prior art (other godot asset lib loggers)
** [ ] consider csharp support + implementation
** [ ] configurable per-type prettyprint overrides
example: i want to impl a to_printable for PandoraEntities without subclassing it

type->to_printable opts passed in as a dictionary?
ideally written as a config of some kind

but how to read it from a static function?
maybe need to write constants to disk like pandora does?

could read/write from a ~res://log.gd~ for opts.
(this is what gd-plug does, for example)

- specify colors for types
- specify to_printable overrides
  - for eg, a fallback for PandoraEntities

--

this is possible via the registry - but it's not yet documented
** [ ] configurable colors and multiple schemas
- pretty colors
- terminal-safe colors
- custom color dictionary
** [ ] hide/show logs based on arbitrary categories

** [ ] hide/show logs based on script name
